# Installing cardano-node

If you are simply interested in holding and using ADA, there is no need to separately install and run `cardano-node`; it is shipped with the [https://daedaluswallet.io/](Daedalus) wallet.

The rest of this document assumes you want to run your own node. The main reason you might wish to do this is if you want to run your own stake pool.

There are three ways to obtain cardano-node (in increasing order of complexity):

- Use the pre-built binaries shipped by IOHK
- Build (or install from cache) using the [Nix][nix] package manager.
- Install the dependencies and tool chain manually and build from source.

## Pre-built binaries

TODO where are these found?

## Build using nix

The [Nix][nix] package manager can be installed atop of most Linux or Macintosh installations, and will take care of provisioning all the build and runtime dependencies of `cardano-node`.

Firstly, follow the instructions to install nix on your system. You will require `sudo` access to root.

```bash
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

Nix can be instructed to use the IOHK remote cache. This step is optional, but will greatly speed up building `cardano-node`. It can be set up as follows:

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nix
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/nix/nix.conf
substituters = https://cache.nixos.org https://hydra.iohk.io
trusted-public-keys = iohk.cachix.org-1:DpRUyj7h7V830dp/i6Nti+NEO2/nhblbov/8MW7Rqoo= hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ= cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=
EOF
```

Note: if you are using NixOS, you should instead add the binary cache to your `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`.

Once you have completed the Nix installation, you can build the node as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node
cd cardano-node
nix-build -A scripts.mainnet.node -o mainnet-node-local
./mainnet-node-local
```

This will build the master branch of `cardano-node`. For building a specific release, check out the relevant [https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases](release) commit.

## Building the node manually

**Latest version:** [https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases)

#### Prerequisites

Set up your platform:

You will need:

* An x86 host \(AMD or Intel\), Virtual Machine or AWS instance with at least 2 cores, 4GB of RAM and at least 10GB of free disk space;
* A recent version of Linux.

#### Install dependencies

We need the following packages and tools on our Linux system to download the source code and build it:

* the version control system `git`,
* the `gcc` C-compiler,
* C++ support for `gcc`,
* developer libraries for the arbitrary precision library `gmp`,
* developer libraries for the compression library `zlib`,
* developer libraries for `systemd`,
* developer libraries for `ncurses`,
* `ncurses` compatibility libraries,
* the Haskell build tool `cabal`,
* the GHC Haskell compiler.

In Redhat, Fedora and Centos

    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum install git gcc gcc-c++ tmux gmp-devel make tar wget zlib-devel libtool autoconf -y
    sudo yum install systemd-devel ncurses-devel ncurses-compat-libs -y

For Debian/Ubuntu use the following instead:


    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo apt-get install automake build-essential pkg-config libffi-dev libgmp-dev libssl-dev libtinfo-dev libsystemd-dev zlib1g-dev make g++ tmux git jq wget libncursesw5 libtool autoconf -y

If you are using a different flavor of Linux, you will need to use the package manager suitable for your platform instead of `yum` or `apt-get`, and the names of the packages you need to install might differ.

#### Install GHC and Cabal

The required versions are [GHC 8.6.5][ghc865] and [Cabal-3.0][cabal30].
The easiest way to install these is using the Haskell installer tool [ghcup][ghcup].

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
```
confirm 2x ENTER and type YES at the end to add ghcup to your PATH variable
Then restart your terminal session or execute

```
source ~/.ghcup/env
```
to use the ghcup command for the next steps

Now install and activate the required GHC version
```
ghcup install ghc 8.6.5
ghcup set ghc 8.6.5
```

#### Install Libsodium

    git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/libsodium
    cd libsodium
    git checkout 66f017f1
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Add the following to your .bashrc file and source it.

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"

#### Download the source code for cardano-node

Back in the home directory:

    git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node.git

Change the working directory to the downloaded source code folder:

    cd cardano-node

Checkout the latest version of cardano-node

    git fetch --all --tags
    git tag
    git checkout tags/<TAGGED VERSION>

#### Build and install the node

Build and install the node with `cabal`,

    cabal build all

Copy the executables files to the `.local/bin` directory. Replace the place holder <TAGGED VERSION> with your targeted version:

    cp -p dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-8.6.5/cardano-node-<TAGGED VERSION>/x/cardano-node/build/cardano-node/cardano-node ~/.local/bin/

    cp -p dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-8.6.5/cardano-cli-<TAGGED VERSION>/x/cardano-cli/build/cardano-cli/cardano-cli ~/.local/bin/

Check the version installed:

    cardano-cli --version

If you need to update to a newer version repeat this process.


**Note:** It might be necessary to delete the `db`-folder \(the database-folder\) before running an updated version of the node.
